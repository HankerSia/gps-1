GPS
======

This code is a reimplementation of the guided policy search algorithm and LQG-based trajectory optimization, meant to help others understand, reuse, and build upon existing work.

For full documentation, see [rll.berkeley.edu/gps](http://rll.berkeley.edu/gps).

The code base is **a work in progress**. See the [FAQ](http://rll.berkeley.edu/gps/faq.html) for information on planned future additions to the code.

This code reimplements the code at [Chelsea's account](https://github.com/cbfinn/gps) using ROS_Indigo. I used ros indigo since Fuerte is no longer maintained.

See example simulation results of running the pr2_example at
